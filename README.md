# EnzymeStructuralFiltering


Structural filtering pipeline using docking and active site heuristics to prioritze ML-predicted enzyme variants for experimental validation. 

This tool processes superimposed ligand poses and filters them using geometric criteria such as distances, angles, and optionally, esterase-specific filters or nucleophilic proximity.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Parse and apply SMARTS patterns to ligand structures.
- Filter poses based on geometric constraints.
- Optional esterase or nucleophile-focused analysis.
- Supports CSV and pickle-based data pipelines.
